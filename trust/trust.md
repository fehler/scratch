Kick off with some context about the importance of trust as a commodity in business. Maybe a quote by Drucker?

Benefits if an open, honest and transparent culture. Pay off is in the long term.

End this section on Facebook…? (Contextualises image.)

Facebook’s launch of Portal – and the subsequent backlash the product received on social media – is evidence of how a breach of trust can erode brand loyalty in a manner that can rapidly spiral out of control. The business’s handling of the Cambridge Analytica scandal – particularly the initial silence of its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg – eroded trust in the brand.


Google Minus
------------

On 8 October, Google announced ‘Project Strobe’ an initiative designed to protect customers’ data, improve the business’s third-party APIs, and – tucked away at the end of the list – sunset Google+.

Buried in the announcement was an admission that one of Google+’s APIs had leaked the private information of over 500,000 users to third-party developers between 2015 and 2018.

Leaking the private information of half a million users is bad enough, but what was worse was the fact that an internal memo, obtained by the Wall Street Journal, revealed Google had covered up the breach due to fear of regulatory repercussions. As the Journal summarised:

> The memo […] warned the company’s senior executives that disclosing the incident would spark “immediate regulatory interest” and that it “almost guarantees [CEO] Sundar [Pichai] will testify before Congress.”

That Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO, was aware of this and chose to keep the breach buried is alarming. It demonstrates either: a lack of understanding of the importance of the bond of trust between a business and its customers, or a flagrant disregard for those customers.

The damage that this breach of trust does to Google’s brand is measured not in days, weeks or months, but in years. There are, of course, lessons to be learned here and you don’t need to be a company the size of Google to learn them.

Trust – perhaps above everything – else is your most important commodity. Cultivating an open and honest business culture will pay off in the long run. When things go wrong, as they occasionally do, own up and take responsibility. Your customers will appreciate your honesty and you’ll protect that all-important bond of trust.
