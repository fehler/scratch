NUX7 Talk Ideas
===============

**17 August, 2018**

I've been thinking about this for months. I have a couple of options, which are, in a sense, connected:

+ Option 1: Everything Connected

+ Option 2: Content for the future… /* Working title. */



Everything Connected
--------------------


1. The first is along the lines of what we discussed: That we need to consider the whole experience across various different platforms and devices. This is a kind of ‘Everything Connected’ talk, where I talk about how our work as UXers increasingly considers the full range of devices on offer (desktop, mobile, smartspeakers, etc.). This is similar to my ‘We Are Orchestrators’ talk at Pixel Pioneers:

https://pixelpioneers.co/events/belfast-2017

The description is on the page, click on the title of my talk. That talk went down a treat, it had quite a bit of typical Mr Murphy humour so it would wake up the audience, post-lunch. I’d be doing a development of that talk (I have way more ideas now!).

——

2. The second is more about taking a more future friendly approach to what we do as UXers: That we need to design for the present, but also with an eye on the future. As an example, my Glyph publication (http://www.getglyph.org) for Little Printer (https://vimeo.com/32796535)… It no longer works, because Little Printer is dead. :-( However, the content is all still there, it used future-friendly markup so we’re repurposing it as a progressive web app (PWA).

So this talk is more about how the content we create or shape as designers, increasingly has a life beyond the platform we designed it for and we need to think about the possible destinations we design for, when we craft our content. So here’s the very first letter from Glyph:

http://getglyph.org/v1/alphabets/0001-a-taz-hair-14/

That worked on Little Printer, but it will also work for our PWA, and could even work as an Amazon Alexa Skill. Put simply: **Freeing the content from a single destination platform (say a website), liberates it to be used anywhere.**

This talk is more about an extension of John Alsopp’s ‘The Dao of Web Design’ article:

https://alistapart.com/article/dao

Alsopp states:

> Now is the time for the medium of the web to outgrow its origins in the printed page. Not to abandon so much wisdom and experience, but to also chart its own course, where appropriate.

This talk takes that idea and runs with it, asking: Where might this content end up?

+ Being spoken, via a voice assistant;
+ In a heads-up display (like Apple’s much-rumoured AR glasses);
+ ANYWHERE

I think this talk is really interesting. It’s different to the Pixel Pioneers talk, but it much more closely echoes where I’m going with my UX book, which is very much focused on designing for *as many future delivery platforms* as possible.
