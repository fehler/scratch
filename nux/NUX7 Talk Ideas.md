NUX7 Talk Ideas
===============

**17 August, 2018**

I’ve been thinking about this for months. I have a couple of options, which are inter-related:

+ Option 1: Everything Connected

+ Option 2: Content for the future… /* Working title. */

I’m gravitating towards Option 2, although I need to come up with a snappier title.

This idea – that you never know where content will end up (in years… decades) to come – is something I’m very much pre-occupied with. We’ve been talking about [future friendly](http://futurefriendlyweb.com/thinking.html) approaches for decades and we’re now very much living in an era that’s rich in ecosystem – platforms and devices – that deliver on the **create once, publish everywhere** promise.

With the work I’m currently doing converting [Glyph](http://www.getglyph.org) into a progressive web application, I think there’s an interesting – and hands-on – story there. I’m also exploring other delivery platforms for this micro-content (Alexa?) so that ties in nicely.

Lastly, my past work at [Fällt](http://www.fallt.com), which very much explored delivering content across multiple platforms – analogue (compact disc, vinyl, cassette…) and digital (MP3, FLA, PDF…) – is work that stretches back to the mid-nineties, so I’ve been practicing what I’m preaching for quite some time.

On the latter note, I haven’t really shared the story of Fällt. I only started sharing it with this audience (web, user experience) at Pixel Pioneers and I finally feel comfortable to share this aspect of my past catalogue of work.

Anyhow, as you can tell, this is me thinking aloud.



Everything Connected
--------------------

The first idea for a talk is along the lines of what Rick and I discussed: That we need to consider the whole experience across various different platforms and devices. This is a kind of ‘Everything Connected’ talk, where I talk about how our work as UXers increasingly considers the full range of devices on offer (desktop, mobile, smartspeakers, etc.). This is similar to my [‘We Are Orchestrators’](https://pixelpioneers.co/events/belfast-2017) talk at Pixel Pioneers.

The description is on the page, click on the title of my talk. That talk went down a treat, it had quite a bit of typical Mr Murphy humour in it so it would wake up the audience, post-lunch. I’d be doing a development of that talk (I have far more ideas now!).



Content for the future…
-----------------------

/* As I noted above, this isn’t the title, I need to work on that. */

The second idea for a talk is more about taking a more future friendly approach to what we do as UXers: That we need to design for the present, but also with an eye on the future.

Using my [Glyph](http://www.getglyph.org) publication for [Little Printer](https://vimeo.com/32796535) as an example…. It no longer works, because Little Printer is dead. :-( However, the content’s all still available for re-use and it was designed using future-friendly markup so we’re repurposing it as a progressive web app (PWA).

So this talk is more about how the content we create or shape as designers, increasingly has a life beyond the platform we designed it for and we need to think about the possible destinations we design for, when we craft our content.

The very first letter [a](http://getglyph.org/v1/alphabets/0001-a-taz-hair-14/) from Glyph doesn’t work on the Little Printer, because it’s now just a paperweight of unfunctional plastic and metal. But that doesn’t mean the story’s over, the content will also work for our PWA, and could even work as an Amazon Alexa Skill.

Put simply: **Freeing the content from a single destination platform (say a website), liberates it to be used anywhere.**

This talk is more about an extension of John Alsopp’s [‘The Dao of Web Design’](https://alistapart.com/article/dao) article, in which Alsopp states:

> Now is the time for the medium of the web to outgrow its origins in the printed page. Not to abandon so much wisdom and experience, but to also chart its own course, where appropriate.

This talk takes that idea and runs with it, asking: Where might this content end up?

+ Being spoken, via a voice assistant;
+ In a heads-up display (like Apple’s much-rumoured AR glasses);
+ ANYWHERE

I think this talk is really interesting. It’s different to the Pixel Pioneers talk, but it much more closely echoes where I’m going with my forthcoming UX book, which is very much focused on designing for *as many future delivery platforms* as possible.
