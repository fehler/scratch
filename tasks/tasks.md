As knowledge workers toiling at the digital coalface, we regularly find ourselves managing multiple tasks at once. All too often those tasks add up, rendering it hard to focus and get things done.

Establishing a task management, or to-do, system can make all the difference. Your system might be analogue or digital, regardless, it’s important to have a system.

One approach on the analogue side of the equation is the ‘Bullet Journal’ (www.bulletjournal.com), which bills itself as, “The analogue system for the digital age.” Ryder Carroll, creator of the Bullet Journal method, even has a book offering the tantalising prospect that you can: “Track the past, order the present and design the future.”

The Bullet Journal method is tailored around a system of bespoke bullets: points (‘.’) for to-dos; circles (‘o’) for events; dashes (‘–’) for notes; and so on. It might sound complicated, but like any system it gets easier with practice. If you’ve been tracking to-dos via a notebook, it’s worth spending a little time exploring the methodology, which can enhance your existing approach.

On the digital side of the equation, tools like Things (www.culturedcode.com) offer a seamless, software-driven approach to the tricky task of managing tasks. A personal task manager for Apple’s various devices, Things is designed to help you manage and achieve your goals, allowing you to organise all your tasks in one place.

A beautifully designed suite of applications that won an Apple Design Award in 2017, Things makes tracking tasks enjoyable with its delightful interactions. Even if you’re not bought in to Apple’s operating systems, Things is still worth exploring for its elegant user experience design.


The Myth of Multitasking
-------------------------

Mapping out your multiple tasks is, of course, only half of the equation; the other half of the equation is actually completing them, which is where a strategy of focused singletasking comes in.

Doubtless everyone’s heard of multitasking, the magical ability to undertake multiple tasks in tandem. The trouble is, multitasking is a myth. (Or, more accurately, it’s possible, it’s just not productive.) A better approach is to focus on single tasks, sequentially.

Neuroscience has established that multitasking is not only more stressful than undertaking tasks individually, it’s also less productive and technically not even possible. As Cynthia Kubu and Andre Machado, two noted neuroscientists, explain in ‘Why Multitasking Is Bad for You’ (http://bit.ly/multitaskingisbad):

> One study found that just 2.5% of people are able to multitask effectively [and] repeatedly switching back and forth from project to project, like a hummingbird darting from flower to flower, can impair our ability to function at our finest.

Kubu and Machado note that, “isolating out of the multitasking world,” brings many benefits, stressing that we, “unequivocally perform best, one thing at a time.”

What we think of as multitasking is, in fact, just the brain switching rapidly between tasks and doing so inefficiently. A far better approach is to sidestep multitasking and work your way through your task list a single task at a time.

Put together the two halves of the equation – a task management system, be it analogue, digital (or both); and a singletasking mindset – and you’ll have a recipe for productivity success.
