This needs to kick off wtih a note that we’re often managing multiple tasks at once and the key to productivity lies in establishing a system that ensure you remain focused and on point.

There are a wealth of approaches, both analogue and digital that one can embrace. <!-- Is it ‘one’? Or ‘you’? -->

One approach on the analogue side of the equation is the ‘Bullet Journal’ (www.bulletjournal.com), which bills itself as, “The analogue system for the digital age.” Ryder Carroll, creator of the Bullet Journal method, even has a book that offers the tantalising prospect that you can: “Track the past, order the present and design the future.”

The Bullet Journal method is tailored around a system of bullet points: points (‘.’) for to-dos; circles (‘o’) for events; dashes (‘–’) for notes and so on. It might sound complicated, but like any system it gets easier with practice. If you’ve been tracking to-dos via a notebook, it’s worth spending a little time exploring the methodology, which can enhance your existing approach.

Everyone is different, but there’s something to be said for maintaining a paper-based archive of tasks completed, if only for the satisfaction of browsing that archive from time to time to see how productive you once were!

On the digital side of the equation, tools like Things (www.culturedcode.com) offer a seamless, software-driven approach to the tricky task of to-dos. An award-winning personal task manager, Things is designed to help you manage and achieve your goals.



The Myth of Multitasking
------------------------

This is a little more theoretical… it’s about the inability of the human brain to focus on more than one thing at once. I need to make sure it doesn’t tread too heavily into the ground I covered on ‘Distractions’ (although this article’s subtly different).
