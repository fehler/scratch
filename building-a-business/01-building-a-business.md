Building a Business
===================

Christopher Murphy explores the process of building a business, from a company of one to an agency of many, sharing some strategies that help you plan ahead for future growth.



Introduction
------------

In these days of relatively low cost design tools and hyper-connectivity, it’s easier than ever to establish and expand a business. In this article, I’ll explore strategies for building a business, growing from a role as a freelancer in a ‘company of one’, to managing multiple employees as a ‘boutique agency’.

The good news is that the opportunities for smaller, boutique agencies are growing. With the reach that the web affords, it’s possible to establish a small, focused agency that can take on larger projects that have the potential for growth.

Even if you’re starting out solo or in a partnership, it helps to plan ahead, getting the foundations for growth in place so that you’re all set to go should the work come flooding in.



It’s all about the clients…
---------------------------

It’s impossible to build a business without clients so it’s important 
to establish strategies upfront to develop a solid client base.

Word of mouth is often the best approach to finding new clients and –  if all has gone according to plan – you should have at least a handful of initial clients who can act as your first wave of champions. Think of these as your trailblazers, they’re the ones that you can gently encourage to share your story, passing on your details – and an all-important recommendation – to their peer network.

Happy customers often open the door to other (hopefully equally happy) customers. With that in mind, it’s important to ensure that every client’s experience is a delightful one. Underpromise, over deliver and ensure you’re communications are always clear; even if you’re running a little behind on a deliverable, honesty’s the best policy.

Testimonials on your website – right up front on your primary landing pages – can make all the difference. Testimonials increase trust, showcase the scope of your client base and – above all – demonstrate client appreciation, they’re useful for putting new clients’ minds at rest, showing that you have an established track record. It’s equally helpful to list your clients right up front, again, this builds believability.

Leads, leads, leads!
--------------------

In addition to word of mouth there are a multitude of tools you can put in place for generating leads via your studio’s website. Tools like Continually (http://continual.ly), Intercom (https://www.intercom.com) and JivoChat (https://www.jivochat.com) enable you to turn your website’s passing visitors into possible clients.

By allowing you to start a conversation with your website’s visitors, client engagement tools enable you to connect with potential new customers and increase your online sales. Whilst word of mouth client recommendations are usually stronger leads, these tools are still a route to potential new leads.

By allowing you to drag and drop content fragments to create conversational pitches, tools like Continually enable you to build intelligent digital sales assistants, available night and day.

There’s been a huge growth in this category of tools thanks to the rise of big data, machine learning and conversational interfaces. Not only are client engagement tools useful to studios eager to grow, they’re also a useful additional offering for clients.

If you’re looking for an all-in-one chat platform, JivoChat (http://bit.ly/jivoreferral) offers design studios 30% in recurring commission for each client install plus free usage of their platform. This allows you to try the tool and earn money, too. Win, win.

Develop Lead Magnets
--------------------

In my article ‘Share’ (Issue #298) I explored the value of content strategy and content marketing. As I noted: “In today’s connected world it’s possible to share your thinking with a global audience who are just a click away. The web offers a wealth of content, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t room for another voice: yours.”

One powerful content marketing approach is the creation of ‘lead magnets’, incentives designed to build audiences. A lead magnet is a term for a piece of content that attracts leads (hence the magnetic metaphor) and they’re usually digitally downloadable content: ebooks, checklists and other information-focused resources.

Googling ‘lead magnet’ returns 53,800,000 results so there’s a great deal of noise you’ll have to cut through, but take a strategic approach and you can still stand out from the crowd. 

Focus on a specific niche – an area your studio specialises in – and build your content around that. In time, you’ll be rewarded with an audience that not only grows, but that values you and your studio’s perspective.

Lead magnets don’t have to be time-consuming to build. Beacon (https://beacon.by), a startup based in Belfast, offers a web-based tool that enables you to create professional looking magnets in minutes.

Customer Lifetime Value
-----------------------

Acquiring new customers – whether it’s through client engagement tools or lead magnets – can be costly. A better approach to building your business is to focus on the customers you have and grow their value over time by maximising their Customer Lifetime Value (CLV).

In my article ‘Loyalty’ (Issue #303) I explored this idea in depth, noting: “Customer Lifetime Value is the amount a customer spends with you over their lifetime and it’s where your true growth lies. Every sale you make is the start of a new relationship, focus on that and the growth will follow.”

Over time as you build your business, you’ll very likely discover that a core set of clients contribute the majority of the income. It’s absolutely critical that you take care of these core clients, they’re the beating heart of your business. Consider how you can serve them better and be proactive in assisting them and you’ll soon supercharge your business growth.

Your relationship with your clients will – all being well – grow over time. Ideally, you’ll nurture your clients and, as their business grows, so too will your opportunities to satisfy their need for additional services, maximising their ‘Customer Lifetime Value’ (CLV).



Build a Team
------------

As your client base grows and the scope of your projects widens and deepens, you’ll need to give some thought to building a team. In the early days of your business, your team will probably be loose and informal, but – over time – it can become the foundation upon which to build an agency of many.

One of the benefits of being a ‘company of one’ is that your working relationships are flexible at the outset. Hiring other freelancers on an ad hoc basis as you grow your business allows you to explore other designers’ and developers’ strengths and weaknesses. It also allows you to pinpoint who has the skills that complement yours and, equally importantly, who is reliable.

As you build your team, build with the future in mind. Ideally the ad hoc team you build in the early days will be your future co-founders or employees.

We work in a competitive sector where skilled and talented freelancers are in high demand and can command generous salaries. As you start to build a list of potential partners and employees, bear in mind that the freelancers you hire will be vetting you as much as you are vetting them. Always be on your best behaviour!



T-Shaped for the win!
---------------------

Our industry has expanded considerably over the last decade and now encompasses more areas of specialism than one person can realistically encompass. Finding the right people – researchers, designers, developers, and all the other areas of specialism – is the first step in building a business.

The reality is that you’ll have to wear a lot of hats when you’re starting out, so focus on learning as much as possible. The more you can develop a rounded vision of all the roles a project requires, the better. This early experience traversing disciplines will enable you to manage others more effectively.

When considering potential team members, look for ‘T-Shaped’ designers. Tim Brown, the CEO of global design company IDEO, defines T-Shaped people as having two kinds of characteristics: the vertical stroke of the ‘T’ represents their depth of skill in a field; whilst the horizontal stroke of the ‘T’ represents their ability to collaborate across disciplines.

When building a team, try to ensure that the candidates you consider possess these characteristics. Focus on individuals who have different, but overlapping areas of specialism and who share a common design vocabulary, and you’ll build a stronger, more effective team.

Learn During Down-Time
----------------------

As you build your business it’s important to keep an eye on the future. We work in an industry that is evolving at an alarming rate. New tools and techniques are emerging at a dizzying rate. As such, it’s important to identify inquisitive individuals that are always eager to learn.

All studios have down-time, even the largest; down-time certainly shouldn’t be dead-time, however. Instead, re-purpose it and put it to good use for learning and skills acquisition.

Identify an up-and-coming skillset, something you don’t know, and put your mind to work on it. It might be conversational interfaces, connected products or something else entirely, the important thing is you’re learning and future-proofing your studio.

Once you’ve learned something new, set aside some time and run a ‘lunch and learn’ session. These sessions, focused on sharing knowledge, are an opportunity to build team morale and strengthen your team’s knowledge.

Even better, share your learning beyond the studio. Build a project and share it on Codepen (http://bit.ly/codepenelements), helping others in the process. This is the kind of work that gets you noticed, it can lead to new partnerships with other studios or help you establish a reputation as an individual or a team that’s at the forefront of their thinking.

Streamline Processes
--------------------

With a team in place, it helps to put some thought into developing a standardised set of processes that you can use to improve your efficiency. By encouraging the adoption of a modular approach towards your client work, you can build a more cost-effective service.

Just like we consider the ‘onboarding experience’ for a website or an application, so too, we can consider the onboarding experience for our clients, improving our workflows and the clients’ experience.

Think of this as a ‘design system’ for your business and its future growth. By formalising your processes, you can ease new team members into your working methods as you grow, and develop a flexible ‘mix and match’ offering, able to be tailored to different client’s needs.

In a short feature article it’s difficult to cover this process in depth, so – in the spirit of sharing best practice – I’ve built a GitHub repository that offers a deeper dive into the process (https://github.com/fehler/hop-onboard/). I’m a firm believer in sharing best practice, so I’m more than happy to open source my process. Feel free to fork the repo and tailor it to suit your own, specific requirements as your studio grows.



Closing Thoughts
----------------

As you take the first steps on your business journey, it helps to set aside some time to plan ahead for the future. You never know where you’ll end up so it’s always a good idea to be prepared. Establishing a vision at the outset provides you with a clear sense of direction and a roadmap you can follow. This forward planning can make all the difference between success and failure.

You might be a company of one when you start out, but there’s no reason you can’t grow into an agency of many. Taking care of your clients will lead to further opportunities down the road. Nurture relationships, not just with clients, but with your peers, and the opportunities will follow.

The good news is that the opportunities for smaller, boutique agencies are growing. With the reach that the web affords, it’s possible to establish a small, focused agency that can take on larger projects that have the potential for growth.

Many of the best known studios started as solo projects or partnerships so there’s no harm in dreaming big. Who knows, your studio might be the next superstudio. Good luck on your adventure!
