Introduction
------------

In these days of relatively low cost design tools and hyper-connectivity, it’s easier than ever to establish and expand a business. In this article, I’ll explore strategies for building a business, growing from a role as a freelancer in a ‘company of one’, to managing multiple employees as a ‘boutique agency’.

The good news is that the opportunities for smaller, boutique agencies are growing. With the reach that the web affords, it’s possible to establish a small, focused agency that can take on larger projects that have the potential for growth.

Even if you’re starting out solo or in a partnership, it helps to plan ahead, getting the foundations for growth in place so that you’re all set to go should the work come flooding in.

It’s all about the clients…
---------------------------

It’s impossible to build a business without clients so it’s important 
to establish strategies upfront to develop a solid client base.

Word of mouth is often the best approach to finding new clients and –  if all has gone according to plan – you should have at least a handful of initial clients who can act as your champions. Think of these as your trailblazers, they’re the ones that you can gently encourage to share your story.

Happy customers often open the door to other (hopefully happy) customers. With that in mind, it’s important to ensure that every client’s experience is a delightful one.

Testimonials on your website – right up front on your primary landing pages – can make all the difference. Testimonials increase trust, showcase the scope of your client base and – above all – demonstrate client appreciation, they’re useful for putting new clients’ minds at rest, showing that you have an established track record.

It’s equally helpful to list your clients right up front. <!-- Explain why if I’m short on words. -->

Leads, leads, leads!
--------------------

In addition to word of mouth there are a multitude of tools you can put in place for generating leads via your studio’s website. Tools like Continually (http://continual.ly), Intercom (https://www.intercom.com) and JivoChat (https://www.jivochat.com) enable you to turn your website’s visitors into potential clients.

By allowing you to start a conversation with your website’s visitors, client engagement tools enable you to connect with potential new customers and increase your online sales. Whilst word of mouth client recommendations are usually stronger leads, these tools are still a route to potential new leads.

By allowing you to drag and drop content fragments to create conversational pitches, tools like Continually enable you to build intelligent digital sales assistants, available night and day.

There’s been a huge growth in this category of tools thanks to the rise of big data, machine learning and conversational interfaces. Not only are client engagement tools useful to studios eager to grow, they’re also a useful addition to your offering for clients.

If you’re looking for an all-in-one chat platform, JivoChat offers design studios 30% in recurring commission for each client install plus free usage of their platform. This allows you to try the tool and earn money, too. Win, win.

Develop Lead Magnets
--------------------

Explain what ‘lead magnets’ are and why they’re useful.

This is about turning your thinking into easily downloadable content that you can share with potential clients, etc.. It’s about list-building and the benefits of lead magnets.



Customer Lifetime Value
-----------------------

Acquiring new customers can be costly. A better approach to building your business is to focus on the customers you have and grow their value over time. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)…

/* Explain what customer lifetime value is and why it matters. Stress the 80-20 rule. Mention Pareto. Reference my article in @netmag #XXX… perhaps a pull-quote from that. */

<!-- There’s a useful Shopify article on this… -->

In addition to the monetary cost incurred to acquire new customers there’s also a time cost. Every new client you acquire needs to be ‘onboarded’ and introduced to your working process. A process that takes time (and therefore incurs a cost).

Your existing customers will, of course, understand your processes. In this context, it makes sound business sense to widen and deepen your relationships with your existing client base, expanding each client’s potential profitability over the long term.

Your relationship with your clients will – all being well – grow over time. Ideally, you’ll nurture your clients and, as their business grows, so too will your opportunities to satisfy their need for additional services, maximising their ‘Customer Lifetime Value’ (CLV).




Build a Team
------------

/* I have a line from the scratch file that I deleted, insert it here, it opens this section.*/

In this section I’m explaining that a team might be loose and informal to begin with, but – over time – it can become the foundation upon which to build a multi-employee studio.

Unicorns are, thankfully, a thing of the past… teams are where it’s at. As you build your team, build with the future in mind. Ideally the team you build will be your future co-founders or employees.

One of the benefits of being an ‘company of one’ is that your working relationships are fluid. Hiring other freelancers as you grow your business allows you to explore different people’s strengths and get to know who has the skills that complement yours and, equally importantly, 

Over time, however, it’s worth making a note of freelancers you can rely on. Firstly, over time you’ll probably work with them more, but also… these might might be your first full-time employees or co-founders.

You don’t need to build a business, of course, you might want to remain as a lone wolf, that’s fine, but you will very likely have to work with others…



T-Shaped for the win!
---------------------

UX has expanded considerably over the last decade and now encompasses more areas of specialism than one person can realistically encompass. Finding the right people: researchers, designers (UX and UI), client services, and all the other areas of specialism is the first step in building a business.

The reality is that you’ll encompass a great deal of these areas on your own when you start out, so focus on learning as much as possible, but it’s a good idea to start identifying individuals that would fit the various roles you’ll need…

It can be difficult to justify spending on learning when your business is a business of on (or two), but don’t take shortcuts. The ROI in education is tangible. Go to conferences is a great way to learn and, just as importantly, grow your network.

Everyone should be T-shaped, insert definition here. Ensure the team:

1. Focuses on different, but overlapping areas; and
2. Speaks a shared language.

However, it’s a good idea for the team to have complementary areas of specialism.



Always Learning
---------------

/* This is about the importance of always learning. There should never be dead time, if there is, re-purpose it and put it towards good use. Identify an un-and-coming skillset and put your mind to work on it. Then, share what you learned. */

This is really important and might be nice to include in the screenshots… This might also be about Codepen, etc., like the Periodic Table screenshot. What’s nice about that is that it’s both side project and sharing, win.

This is the kind of work that gets you noticed, it can lead to new partnerships with other studios… it also helps to establish a reputation as an individual or a team that’s at the forefront of thinking or at the top of your game… 

LT…? The company is focused on staff development, regularly attending conferences and running ‘lunch and learn’ sessions monthly to widen and deepen the team’s knowledge. They share.

Codepen, etc..



Streamline Processes
--------------------

With a team in place, it helps to put some thought into developing a standardised set of processes that you can use to improve your efficiency. By encouraging the adoption of a modular approach towards your client work, you can build a more cost-effective service.

Just like we consider the ‘onboarding experience’ for a website or an application, so too, we can consider the onboarding experience for our clients, improving our workflows and the clients’ experience.

Think of this as a ‘design system’. Just as a design system formalises the components of a specific project’s design, this studio-level approach formalises the repeatable processes of a typical studio project so that it can be undertaken more efficiently.

The important point is to find repeatable processes – tasks you undertake for all of your clients – and modularise them. By doing so  your offering can be more aggressively priced for SMEs, whilst allowing for a flexible ‘mix and match’ offering able to be tailored to different enterprise’s needs.

In a single feature it’s hard to find the space to cover this process in depth, so – in the spirit of sharing best practice – I’ve built a GitHub repository that offers a deeper dive into the process. I’m a firm believer in sharing best practice, so I’m more than happy to share this.

A little more on the system (take it from the opening paragraph of the repo).

Closing Thoughts
----------------

Above all, my advice would be to plan for the future. Establish a vision at the outset and you’ll find yourself with a clear roadmap to follow.

You might be a company of one at this point in time, but taking care of your clients will lead to further opportunities down the road. Nurture relationships, not just with clients, but with your peers…

Even if your business is a business of one, it will still – very likely – involve working with others. Unicorns are, thankfully, a thing of the past… teams are where it’s at. As you build your team, build with the future in mind…

Relationships that start out as casual, can build over time, into something substantial and strong. Many of the best known studios started as solo projects or partnerships… who knows, your studio might be the next?
