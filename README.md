# Scratch

I established this repository to gather scratch files for articles, conference talks and workshops I’m currently working on. The repository enables me to version control my content and, where needs be, share it with collaborators.

**The content here is largely private, I wouldn’t waste time reading any of this; most of the content is fleeting, in-progress thinking.**
