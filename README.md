# Scratch

I established this repository to gather scratch files for articles I’m writing that are currently in progress. The repository enables me to version control my articles and, where needs be, share them with collaborators. The content here is largely private, I wouldn’t waste time reading any of this; most of the content is fleeting, in-progress thinking.
