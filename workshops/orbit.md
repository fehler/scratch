Orbit Programme
===============

The Orbit programme will feature **five half-day workshops** with **accompanying downloadable materials** that supplement the workshops' content. The five workshops as I envisage them are connected, with **a narrative thread that runs through them**. The following isn't set in stone, but it gives an initial impression about how I'd approach the programme.

**Were I to be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme, I would work with Craft NI to refine the materials so that what we deliver fits Craft NI's strategic goals meeting any Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) identified.**

Before I outline my proposed workshop content, I think it's worth stressing that **I believe we could use the curriculum outlined below for an annual series of half-day workshops**. This would maximise the return on our initial investment developing content, allowing us to increase the impact of the material, using it to benefit more craftspeople in future years.

Lastly, **the material I'm proposing to cover could also be developed further as a standalone, downloadable package of material**, similar to work I've undertaken for Adobe. If we were to undertake a joint Craft NI + Mr Murphy Ltd. grant application, we could explore ways in which we develop the material so that it was available for all craftspeople – in Northern Ireland – and beyond.

**In short: I'm open to working in partnership with Craft NI to explore ways in which we can maximise the overall impact of these learning materials.**



Workshops
---------

The workshops, whilst featuring content that can be consumed individually, are intended to be undertaken as a series. I'd suggest we **encourage participants to sign up for all the workshops by offering a discounted price for the complete package of workshops**, for example:

+ 1 Workshop: £25
+ 5 Workshop Bundle: £100 (Save £25)

Each workshop is intended to last half a day, but – depending upon the overall budget available – could include **pre-content that is distributed to participants in advance of the workshops so they can prepare**.

In addition to the core workshop content, I would envisage providing additional downloadable learning materials. This content would be similar to the materials I've developed for my Tiny Books 'course in a book' [Start! Stop Procrastinating and Pursue Your Passion](http://tinybooks.org/books/start/). **This content includes worksheets that I'd encourage attendees to complete in their own time.**



Beacons
-------

Each workshop will feature a ‘Beacon’, a case study that I’ll write up and share with the participants through the workshop's accompanying, downloadable learning materials. Case studies will include:

+ **[Blok Knives](https://blok-knives.co.uk)** (Knives, Homewares)
+ **[Hiut Denim](https://hiutdenim.co.uk)** (Fashion, Textiles)
+ **[Cara Murphy](https://www.caramurphy.com)** (Silversmithing]
+ …

Ben Edwards (Blok Knives) and David Hieatt (Hiut Denim) are friends of mine, and I'm married to Cara Murphy, so **in all three cases I have a lot of 'behind the scenes' material I can draw from**. By building the 'Beacons' around craftspeople like this – who are running successful and profitable craft businesses – we can inspire the attendees and give them real world material to learn from.

**I'd finalise the list of case studies should I be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme, working in conjunction with Craft NI to ensure that we cover the key disciplines they'd like to support.**

Depending upon the programme's budget, we might also consider the creation of some additional case studies, that encompass more craft disciplines. **This content could be developed as a PDF ebook for the participants to download.**

Workshop 1: Product Storytelling: People Buy Stories by People
--------------------------------------------------------------

We’ll kick off our series of half-day workshops with a workshop focused on drilling down into: **you, your product and your products’ stories**. We’ll consider branding and how **stories are the backbone of what we create** bridging the divide between makers and their prospective audience of customers.

We’ll ask: Who are you? What do you make? Most importantly: **What’s your why?**

The question of **why?** is critical and will be the focus of this workshop. We'll use the attendees' whys to enable them to establish a clear narrative for themselves and their products. This will impact upon everything they do.


### Case Study: Blok Knives

In the Blok Knives case study, **we’ll focus on the why of Ben’s products**. Why did Ben make the move from graphic designer to craftsperson? What prompted him to leap from one discipline to another and what lessons can be learned from him and the way he tells his story?

We'll look at how Ben shares his story using a range of different media, including photography and video, and explore how he used narrative and testimonials as a critical part of Blok Knives's story.

**Ben's why is incredibly important to the story of Blok Knives and it's why there’s a four month waiting list to purchase one of his £300+ knives.**


### Learning Outcomes

+ By the end of this workshop, participants will have a clearly defined vision for both themselves and their products’ stories.
+ With this vision defined they'll be able to undertake additional post-workshop homework using the downloadable materials I will provide them with.



Workshop 2: Portfolio Career: Building (Varied) Creative Income Streams
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The second in our series of half-day workshops focuses on **diversifying income streams** so that your products are pitched at **different audiences at different price points**. This diversification is incredibly important to **ensure that income is more robust and 'smoothed out'**, especially during times when cash flow is tight.

We'll ask: What do you currently make and what might you make? **Importantly: We'll get the attendees to start mapping out ideas for potential sources of revenue that they may not have previously considered.**


### Case Study: Cara Murphy, Silversmith

In the Cara Murphy case study, **we'll tease out Cara's range of income streams**. Doing this will enable us to establish a number of potential sources of revenue that include **both** product and service offerings.

Looking at real world examples, we'll see that a commission through [Adrian Sassoon](https://www.adriansassoon.com/artists/cara-murphy/) is a different offering at a different price point to an enamel bowl for sale through [Contemporary Applied Arts](https://www.caa.org.uk/artists/cara-murphy/), London. Both income streams are critical.

**The mix of revenue streams Cara has established is incredibly important to ensuring a diversified revenue base, which ensures she is earning across _a spectrum of opportunity_.**


### Learning Outcomes

+ By the end of this workshop, participants will have identified a number of potential income streams so that they have begun to consider diversifying their product (and service) offerings.
+ With these diversified income streams defined they'll be able to undertake additional post-workshop homework using the downloadable materials I will provide them with.



Workshop 3: Show Me the Money: Pricing and Positioning
------------------------------------------------------

Our third workshop is all about the importance of money and **why getting pricing right is critical to success**. We’ll explore topics like **customer lifetime value** (CLV), defining what it is and why it’s critical to a business. As with the other workshops, I'll use a number of real-world case studies to provide practical, hands-on advice.

We'll also explore the importance of managing time and making the most of it, above all, not wasting it. We'll consider ways in which we might improve efficiency through both batch production methodologies and, where appropriate, outsourcing aspects of a product's production.

At the heart of this half-day workshop is an understanding that money isn't something to be ashamed of, indeed, it's something makers need to consider front and centre if their businesses are to succeed.


### Case Study: TBC

This case study is to be confirmed. I have ideas for potential craftspeople and will develop these should I be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme.


### Learning Outcomes

+ By the end of this workshop, participants will have considered the opportunities that exist to streamline their working processes, maximising the potential profit they can make.
+ With some consideration given to pricing and positioning they'll be able to undertake additional post-workshop homework using the downloadable materials I will provide them with.



Workshop 4: Navigating the Funding Landscape: Writing Successful Grant Applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the fourth of our half-day workshops, **we'll explore the landscape of grants**, considering both **public-sector and private-sector** schemes. In this workshop I'll share successful – and unsuccessful – grant applications, teasing out what leads to a successful application. This half-day will share the contents of my hard drive so participants can see real world grant application examples.

Contrary to popular opinion, **there is a great deal of funding available**, despite austerity. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland's Support for the Individual Artist grants scheme is just one of a wide range of funding opportunitites available. **There are many, many more.**

Using Google (and other search engines) we can identify other grant-making bodies that are further afield, but which still afford valuable opportunities. We'll look at how we can take a single grant application and fine-tune it, using it as the basis for multiple grant applications, maximising the time we invest.


### Case Study: TBC

This case study is to be confirmed. I have ideas for potential craftspeople and will develop these should I be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme.


### Learning Outcomes

+ By the end of this workshop, participants will have identified a range of grant-making bodies and schemes that they can apply to for financial support.
+ With these opportunities defined they'll be able to undertake additional post-workshop homework using the downloadable materials I will provide them with.



Workshop 5: Social Storytelling: Marketing (On- and Offline)
------------------------------------------------------------

The final half-day workshop focuses on the importance of marketing, with **an emphasis on storytelling at the heart of a considered marketing strategy**. We'll explore **off- and online marketing channels**, with examples drawn from a range of different craftspeople and artists to paint a picture of what works (and what doesn't).

In my experience, marketing is often perceived by craftspeople as something that takes up valuable time and that is a distraction. Of course, **making is critical, but so is marketing**. After all, **if no one knows what you do, how can you hope to sell it?**

By looking at how a number of successful craftspeople share their stories – via channels like **Instagram, Twitter and other social channels** – and measuring the impact of these marketing stories, we'll hammer home that marketing is an essential part of every successful business's mix.


### Case Study: TBC

This case study is to be confirmed. I have ideas for potential craftspeople and will develop these should I be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme.


### Learning Outcomes

+ By the end of this workshop, participants will have begun to establish a marketing plan, having considered: 'pillars of content'; marketing 'grids' and other tools (including Buffer) that make marketing more efficient.
+ With an outline marketing plan defined they'll be able to undertake additional post-workshop homework using the downloadable materials I will provide them with.



Craft Meets Business
--------------------

The Orbit tender document stresses Craft NI's desire to **continue to strengthen business development within the craft sector** in Northern Ireland … **providing an understanding of craft practice within a broad business context**. It also outlines a need to:

+ place **business acumen and creative development on an equal footing**;
+ ensure **sensitivity to the nature of craft businesses**;
+ generate a broad understanding of **craft practice within a business context**;
+ provide expertise, guidance and support … to **stimulate innovation in business and creative practice**; and
+ equip designer-makers at various stages of their careers and from different craft disciplines with **new and refreshed business skills**.

The above aims all focus on **the intersection of where craft meets business**. They also **require an understanding that craft businesses are, by their nature, different to many other businesses**. As a designer, married to a successful crafstperson (Cara Murphy), **I am immersed and well-versed in the world where craft meets business**.

**I understand that craft businesses need business support, but they need that support to be delivered in way that is sensitive to how craft businesses differ from those in other sectors.**

As outlined in the section 'Why me?' below, I've delivered a number of similar, business-focused programmes, both in Northern Ireland and further afield. Over 15+ years teaching at Belfast School of Art, I've focused on helping young (and not so young!) craftspeople and designers to **understand the intersection of creativity and business**.

**I'm passionate about helping others to navigate the world of business that can often feel like a minefield.** I've had many successes and many 'failures' during my own journey and I freely share the lessons I've learned – good and bad – in my learning materials.

It's no exageration to say that **I've helped thousands of individuals to deepen their understanding of business, improving their chances of success**, and I would welcome the opportunity to deliver the Orbit programme.
