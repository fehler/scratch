Orbit Programme
===============

The Orbit programme will feature **five half-day workshops** with **accompanying downloadable materials** that supplement the workshops' content. The five workshops as I envisage them are connected, with a narrative thread that runs through them. The following isn't set in stone, but it gives an initial impression about how I'd approach the programme.

Were I to be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme, I would work with Craft NI to refine the materials so that what we deliver fits Craft NI's strategic goals.


Workshops
---------

The workshops, whilst featuring content that can be consumed individually, are intended to be undertaken as a series. I'd suggest we **encourage participants to sign up for all the workshops by offering a discounted price for the complete package of workshops**, for example:

+ 1 Workshop: £25
+ 5 Workshop Bundle: £100 (Save £25)

Each workshop is intended to last half a day, but – depending upon the overall budget available – could include pre-content, content distributed to participants in advance of the workshops so they can prepare.

In addition to the core workshop content, I would envisage providing additional learning materials. This content would be similar to the materials I've developed for my Tiny Books 'course in a book' [Start! Stop Procrastinating and Pursue Your Passion](http://tinybooks.org/books/start/). This content includes worksheets that I'd encourage attendees to complete in their own time.


Beacons
-------

Each workshop will feature a ‘Beacon’, a case study that I’ll write up and share with the participants through the workshop's accompanying, downloadable learning materials. Case studies will include:

+ **[Blok Knives](https://blok-knives.co.uk)** (Knives, Homewares)
+ **[Cara Murphy](https://www.caramurphy.com)** (Silversmithing]
+ …

Ben Edwards (Blok Knives) is a friend of mine and I'm married to Cara Murphy, so in both cases I have a lot of 'behind the scenes' material I can draw from. By building the 'Beacons' around craftspeople like this – who are running successful and profitable craft businesses – we can inspire the attendees and give them real world material to learn from.

**I'll finalise the list of Beacons if I'm appointed, working in conjunction with Craft NI to ensure that we cover the key disciplines they'd like to support. Depending upon the budget, we might also consider the creation of some additional case studies, that encompass more craft disciplines. This content could be developed as a PDF ebook for the participants to download.**

Workshop 1: Product Storytelling: People Buy Stories by People
--------------------------------------------------------------

We’ll kick off our series of half-day workshops with a workshop focused on drilling down into: **you, your product and your products’ stories**. We’ll consider branding and how **stories are the backbone of what we create** bridging the divide between us and our prospective audience.

We’ll ask: Who are you? What do you make? Most importantly: **What’s your why?**

The question of **why?** is critical and will be the focus of this workshop. We'll use the attendees' whys to enable them to establish a clear narrative for themselves and their products. This will impact upon everything they do.

### Case Study: Blok Knives

In the Blok Knives case study, **we’ll focus on the why of Ben’s products**. Why did Ben make the move from graphic designer to craftsperson? What prompted him to leap from one discipline to another and what lessons can be learned from him and the way he tells his story?

We'll look at how Ben shares his story using a range of different media, including photography and video, and explore how he used narrative and testimonials as a critical part of Blok Knives's story.

**Ben's why is incredibly important to the story of Blok Knives and it's why there’s a four month waiting list to purchase one of his £300+ knives.**

### Learning Outcomes

+ By the end of this workshop, participants will have a clearly defined vision for both themselves and their products’ stories.
+ With this vision defined they'll be able to undertake additional post-workshop homework using the downloadable materials I will provide them with.


Workshop 2: Portfolio Career: Building (Varied) Creative Income Streams
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The second in our series of half-day workshops focuses on **diversifying income streams** so that your products are pitched at **different audiences at different price points**. This diversification is incredibly important to **ensure that income is more robust and 'smoothed out'**, especially during times when cash flow is tight.

We'll ask: What do you currently make? What might you make? **Most importantly: We'll get the attendees to start mapping out ideas for potential sources of revenue that they may not have considered.**

### Case Study: Cara Murphy, Silversmith

In the Cara Murphy case study, **we'll tease out Cara's range of income streams**. Doing this will enable us to establish a number of potential sources of revenue that include **both** product and service offerings.

Looking at real world examples, we'll see that a commission through [Adrian Sassoon](https://www.adriansassoon.com/artists/cara-murphy/) is a different offering at a different price point to an enamel bowl for sale through [Contemporary Applied Arts](https://www.caa.org.uk/artists/cara-murphy/), London. Both income streams are critical.

**The mix of revenue streams Cara has established is incredibly important to ensuring a diversified revenue base, which ensures she is earning across _a spectrum of opportunity_.**

### Learning Outcomes

+ By the end of this workshop, participants will have identified a number of potential income streams so that they have begun to consider diversifying their product (and service) offerings.
+ With these diversified income streams defined they'll be able to undertake additional post-workshop homework using the downloadable materials I will provide them with.



Workshop 3: Show Me the Money: Pricing and Positioning
------------------------------------------------------

Our third workshop is all about money and why it's critical to success. We’ll explore topics like customer lifetime value, defining what it is and why it’s critical to a business. As with the other workshops, I'll use a number of real world case studies to provide practical, hands-on advice.

### Case Study: TBC

This case study is to be confirmed. I have ideas for potential craftspeople and will develop these should I be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme.

### Learning Outcomes

+ To follow.


Workshop 4: Navigating the Funding Landscape: Writing Successful Grant Applications
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the fourth of our half-day workshops, **we'll explore the landscape of grants**, considering both **public-sector and private-sector** schemes. In this workshop I'll share successful – and unsuccessful – grant applications (of my own), teasing out what leads to a successful application.

Contrary to popular opinion, **there is a great deal of funding available to contemporary craftspeople**, despite austerity. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland's Support for the Individual Artist grants scheme is just one of a wide range of funding opportunitites available. There are many, many more.

Using Google (and other search engines) we can identify other grant-making bodies that are further afield, but which still afford valuable opportunities. We'll look at how we can take a single grant application and fine-tune it, using it as the basis for multiple grant applications.

### Case Study: TBC

This case study is to be confirmed. I have ideas for potential craftspeople and will develop these should I be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme.

### Learning Outcomes

+ By the end of this workshop, participants will have identified a range of grant-making bodies and schemes that they can apply to for financial support.
+ With these opportunities defined they'll be able to undertake additional post-workshop homework using the downloadable materials I will provide them with.


Workshop 5: Social Storytelling: Marketing (On- and Offline)
------------------------------------------------------------

The final half-day workshop focuses on the importance of marketing, with an emphasis on storytelling at the heart of a considered marketing strategy.

### Case Study: TBC

This case study is to be confirmed. I have ideas for potential craftspeople and will develop these should I be appointed to deliver the Orbit programme.

### Learning Outcomes

+ To follow.
